				<h1>About</h1>

				<h2>Quality</h2>

				<p>Our truffles are beyond what you know as an &lsquo;upper-market&rsquo; truffle. They&rsquo;re produced using fresh cream and a minimal amount of ingredients, as opposed to life-prolonging replacements such as condensed milk or synthetic cream substitutes. Every batch is produced independently and will always have it&rsquo;s own unique characteristics. There is no doubt that the &lsquo;premium&rsquo; is accompanied by the right high product quality.</p> 

				<h2>Awareness</h2>

				<p>All ingredients, allergens, ingredient information and nutritional data is made easily available and understandable for customers. Other brands tend to leave information such as this undisclosed as much as possible, likely in order to hide small, important details or things we may not like to hear.</p>
	
				<h2>Environment</h2>

				<p>Pride is taken in the six recyclable packaging items used in our sales. Most confectioners display over-the-top packaging. The majority of the space consumed in the box is occupied by frequently non-recyclable plastic, bulking the product up and creating the illusion that you&rsquo; getting more for your money. Not only is this a little unfair, there is really no reason to use this potentially harmful packaging when more friendly and cheaper (for both ends) packaging exists. We provide the ideal balance between sustainability in manufacturing / packaging / accurate and fair prices, and brand-echoing elegance.</p>

				<h2>Useful to Know</h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Recommended life or &lsquo;best before&rsquo; of <b>3 weeks post-manufacture</b></li>
					<li>Best refrigerated to improve texture and possibly <b>increase life</b> by two or three weeks</li>
					<li>If not to refrigerating truffles, store in a <b>cool and dry place</b>, preferably in an airtight container</li>
					<li>Allow at least one week for delivery as all products are made to order and dispatched in a bundle at the same timeweekly, by <b>Royal Mail Second Class</b></li>
					<li>Orders placed <b>incorrectly</b> or by mistake by the buyer will not be refunded</li>
					<li>Allow tolerance for product <b>appearance</b> and <b>life</b> upon delivery in the warm months</li>
				</ul>
