# First Instagram Message (Local)

% Message 1

Hi there. We're a small confectionery company from Giffnock and would love the opportunity to share our product with you, and potentially your customers. After almost two years of successful and rewarding direct business with our customers, we hope to expand into sharing interests with our local businesses and hospitality lovers, and beyond. 

We'd like to offer you a free box of truffles, either for your own enjoyment or your customers'. You can find our range here on Instagram, or at: http://vtctruffles.co.uk/Truffles.html. If you love our truffles as much as we and our existing customers do, then great! Let's work together. If not then hey ho, you have a free box of East Renfrewshire's finest truffles. It could be a Himalayan Salted Caramel truffle alongside a cortado, a Coconut Lime & Pistachio truffle as a countertop treat to catch the eyes of your gazing customers, or a pyramid of our Grapefruit Gin truffles as your centerpiece.

Just send us a message here or email vtc.truffles@yahoo.com with the contents of your free test order. For more, just visit: http://vtctruffles.co.uk.

Thanks for taking the time to consider working with us. All the best to yourselves and your business in the coming weeks.
