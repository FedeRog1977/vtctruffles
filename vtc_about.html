			<h2>Beginner's Chemistry of Chocolate</h2>

				<p>
					Achieving the perfect texture of a truffle comes with the management of viscosity. Incorporating ingredients in the correct ratios, with the correct amount of fat leads to a luxurious combination of textures. On VTC truffles, there is only a very thin layer of coating chocolate. This melts quickly, creating textural pleasure through the transition from harder to softer chocolate. The initially cooler and more solid texture of the outer transforms into a smoother ganache of higher viscosity and aids senses of pleasure.
				</p>

			<h2>Quality</h2>

				<p>
					Product differentiation and uniqueness means a great amount, and that is why the products you’ll find here are beyond what you know as an ‘upper-market’ truffle. For a start, our truffles are produced using fresh cream and minimal ingredients, as opposed to life-prolonging replacements such as condensed milk or synthetic cream substitutes. You’ll find this in many mainstream brands. Every batch is produced independently and for a specific customer. High quality ingredients are sourced and are handled these in the according manner. ‘Premium’ branding should correspond to product quality. 
				</p>

			<h2>Awareness</h2>

				<p>
					It’s important that all ingredients, allergens, ingredient information and nutritional data is made easily available and understandable for the customers of Virtuous Truffle Company. Where many other brands tend to hide these things gravitate towards translucency on this topic. Likely in order to hide small, important details or things we may not like to hear. Here, you’ll find the opposite!
				</p>
	
			<h2>Environment</h2>

				<p>
					Pride is taken in the six recyclable packaging items used at Virtuous Truffle Company. Most confectioners display over the top packaging. The majority of the space consumed in the box is occupied by frequently non-recyclable plastic, bulking the product up and creating the illusion that there is more product. Not only is this unfair and an illusional higher markup-method, as we know plastic packaging in cases like this is extremely unnecessary and harmful to our environment: releasing pollutants when produced and harming living organisms when improperly disposed of. Virtuous Truffle Company provides the ideal balance between sustainability and brand-echoing elegance.
				</p>

			<h2>How We Started</h2>

				<p>
					It’s a very simple story really, the one that started it all. In February of 2019, I crafted a fat batch of the Coconut Almond Butter truffles and they were nothing other than annihilated. With this positive reception, there was simply no question around sharing these with more people. Not long later, after various inspections, business initiation processes and safety/hygiene courses, here is my attempt to recreate an excellent experience. 
				</p>

			<h2>Useful to Know</h2>

					<li>Allow at least one week for delivery as all products from a given week are made to order and dispatched at the same time</li>
					<li>Any orders placed incorrectly or by mistake will not be refunded</li>
